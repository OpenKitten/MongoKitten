# MongoKitten

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/OpenKitten/MongoKitten.svg?branch=mongokitten31)](https://travis-ci.org/OpenKitten/MongoKitten)

Native MongoDB driver for Swift, written in Swift. This library does not wrap around the mongoc driver. It uses:

- Our own [BSON](https://github.com/OpenKitten/BSON) library, which is also 100% native Swift
- Our own [MD5, SHA1, SCRAM and PBKDF2 libraries](https://github.com/OpenKitten/CryptoKitten) in 100% Swift (currently included in the package)
- Optional support for SSL/TLS using LibreSSL

## Requirements

- A MongoDB server (local or online) running MongoDB 2.6 or above. (MongoDB 3.2 or 3.4 is recommmended)
- Swift 3.1

## Setting up MongoDB

Install MongoDB for [Ubuntu](https://docs.mongodb.com/master/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/), [macOS](https://docs.mongodb.com/master/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/) or [any other supported Linux Distro](https://docs.mongodb.com/master/administration/install-on-linux/).

Alternatively; make use of a DAAS (Database-as-a-service) like [MLab](https://mlab.com), [Bluemix](https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/mongodb-hosting) or any other of the many services.

## Importing

Add this to your Package.swift file:

`.Package(url: "https://github.com/OpenKitten/MongoKitten.git", majorVersion: 3, minor: 0)`

And `import MongoKitten` in your project.

Note: MongoKitten 4 is ready for release, but depends on features coming in the next version of Vapor. If you'd like to take a peek, use this package URL instead.

`.Package(url: "https://github.com/OpenKitten/MongoKitten.git", "4.0.0-vaportls")`

If you're adding MongoKitten to an existing Xcode project, make sure to rebuild your Xcode project.
